This is a screenshot of all the content on the banner page:

## Lacking a Visual Example

Users can't see what it looks like!

## Overlapping Layout

In the upper right corner, the page outline is overlapping with the top navigation.

This UI bug only appears on this specific page, not any of the other components or pages in the Mintlify documentation.

The cause is a css variable named `--sidenav-move-up` being set to 77px on this page, when it remains at the default value of 0 on every other page.

This "table of contents" is using absolute/sticky positioning and the top property is set to `top-[calc(6rem-var(--sidenav-move-up, 0px))]`.

This means "base" distance from top is 6rem, then this element subtracts the value of the `--sidenav-move-up` variable, and if that variable is not set it defaults to 0.

So if the variable remains at the default, the distance from the top is 6rem - 0. In the banner page the variable is set to 77 causing the distance from the top to be 6rem - 77. This reduces the distance from the top causing the overlap. This variable is being set only on the banner page, and remains at the default of 0 on all other pages.

This is the banner component in the public repo [https://github.com/mintlify/docs/blob/main/components/banner.mdx?plain=1](https://github.com/mintlify/docs/blob/main/components/banner.mdx?plain=1). There is nothing in this .mdx file that sets the variable to 77 or any differences in the structure compared to other components; so it's likely a problem in the interpreter layer that is not public.

While inspecting the overall page structure, I found all 3 primary elements on the page (tabs, content-area, content-side-layout) are positioned absolutely/sticky and spaced using margin instead of a flex or grid layout. This is not an efficient approach to structuring a page layout and reduces developer velocity.

### Open Github Issue

This layout structure also caused problems for other users where some of the content overlaps with the navbar. Likely caused by the same issue as the banner page, where the distance from the top is manually set incorrectly.
