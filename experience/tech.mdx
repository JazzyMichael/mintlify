    ☝️ Javascript, Typescript, Next.js, React, Tailwind.

Next.js is the foundation of high-quality web applications, providing tooling and features that enable fast and efficient development. I'm proficient with every aspect of the framework and enjoy engaging with the community and following each release. Integrates well with cloud services and ORMs while providing route handlers, middleware, and server actions natively in the framework.

In-depth knowledge of rendering strategies including Incremental Static Regeneration, Static Site Generation, Server-Side Rendering, and Hydration & UI-Streaming to bring it all together. I have experience configuring these for many different applications, leveraging the abstractions provided by Next.js to architect intricate and production-grade systems.

The React ecosystem is used for client-side functionality. Tanstack, Zustand, Hooks, Server Components, Data fetching & caching, State-management.

Tailwind-CSS, Shadcn, Radix-UI, Headless-UI, (Framer) Motion, xy/react-flow, Design Systems, Figma, SVG & Native CSS Animations. I'm well-versed in these tools and libraries, and also have a deep understanding of the underlying principles like Data-Attributes; used for framework-agnostic interactivity and state-management without any Javascript overhead.

I like to think I have an eye for design, but I also recognize the value of collaborating with dedicated designers and product developers to create intuitive user interfaces with considerations for the frontend code, ensuring fast performance and maintainability.

Javascript & Typescript Fundamentals: Concurrency & Event-Loop, Closures & Scope, Prototypical Inheritance, Async Patterns, Service Workers, Built-in objects & data structures, Browser APIs & Permissions. Typescript.

I've followed the entire history of JavaScript, from its origins and rapid adoption to the modern ecosystem we know today. Fittingly, I was born in November 1995, around the time Javascript was first introduced, so you could say my passion for coding on the web was destined from the start.

The ability to become proficient with any library/framework/methodology extremely quickly comes from a strong fundamental understanding of the ecosystem. I'm driven by a passion for the internet, technology, and building things.

My first true love in Frontend-Focused Fullstack Development was from 2017-2021; I was immersed in Webview-based Hybrid Apps & PWAs using Angular, Ionic, Capacitor/Cordova, and Firebase. I have fond memories of building TONS of apps as well as enterprise products using this stack. Observables and Singleton patterns were commonplace, and Firebase was the backend glue that wrapped everything together.

I was an early supporter of Jeff Delaney and the 'Fireship' Youtube channel, formerly known as 'AngularFire'. I engaged in the initial testing and formulation of the official Angular-Firebase SDK, and actively participated in Google Developer Group events in Philadelphia as well as other local tech groups.

    I use cloud platforms like Supabase & Vercel to provide infrastructure for cohesive backends supporting Databases, Storage, Auth, Functions, Web Sockets/Real-time events, etc...

    Most of my database experience is using relational databases, only using Vector DBs for curiosity and theoretical learning. I'm proficient with SQL & NoSQL, Schema design, and data normalization for optimized queries and scalability. Postgres is the standard these days and also my go-to database, I also lots of experience with MongoDB and a bunch of ORMs (Prisma, Drizzle, TypeORM, Mongoose).

    When it comes to running and fine-tuning LLMs, Replicate is my perferred cloud provider. I have an app called MelodyMakerAI that I built using Meta/music-gen, and I also enjoy exploring all the LLMs on the Replicate platform.

    Product Architecture is a great term used by Meta to encompass API & Client-Application design for user-facing products and services. I love this aspect of software development. Examples include Social networks, e-commerce stores, payment processing, messaging, real-time interactions, streaming (not just audio/video but data and UI streaming - especially with the advent of AI).

    I'm also comfortable with distributed systems, with experience in the Azure ecosystem for running microservices, redis/KV stores, data replication, and load balancers.

    I also have extensive experience with Payment Processing, using nearly all of Stripe's product offerings as well as card-present transactions for several payment gateways including Spin and Tenerum.

#### Brain-dump of what interests me about AI and how I use it to improve coding efficiency

Working with cutting-edge developer tools like Copilot, Claude, GPT, Cursor, Windsurf, and Bolt empowers me to build faster and experiment more deeply with AI-driven development.

      With OpenAI and Anthropic publicly stating that the majority of their revenue comes from APIs, it's clear they've set the standard for cloud AI providers and developer adoption—making it essential to stay familiar with the current landscape.

Vercel's AI SDK stands out as a favorite of mine because it supports all major models for generations and streaming while also offering powerful UI components that accelerate innovation.

      The profound impact of AI on society becomes even more fascinating when viewed through the lenses of philosophy and economics.

      Insights from leaders of the AI industry offer valuable perspective on the evolving economic landscape of major AI companies in the United States.

Staying up to date with the latest innovations and discussing them with others fuels my excitement, and moving to Silicon Valley will allow me to meet more people who share this passion.

        Scientific breakthroughs across industries are incredibly exciting, and AI continues to be one of the most transformative forces driving them forward.

Transformers, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, Neural Networks, and MCP are just a few areas where I have developed a wide breadth of understanding, often diving deep into topics out of sheer curiosity.

Learning is the most fascinating aspect of life—it's how we grow. Exploring new frontiers like LLMs and AI infrastructure has become one of my greatest passions.

Leveraging the latest AI innovations to create meaningful value for society is a mission that deeply motivates me.

      The AI 2027 paper served as a major inspiration, sparking my desire to study AI in depth, relocate to Silicon Valley, and pursue meaningful work with AI startups.

      Experimentation with local LLMs such as Ollama and Mistral on my own machine provides hands-on experience with running models and testing their capabilities.
