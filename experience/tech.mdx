    Cloud platforms like Supabase & Vercel provide infrastructure for cohesive backends supporting Databases, Storage, Auth, Functions, Web Sockets/Real-time events, etc...

    Most of my database experience is using relational databases, only using Vector DBs for curiosity and theoretical learning. I'm proficient with SQL & NoSQL, Schema design, and data normalization for optimized queries and scalability. Postgres is the standard these days and also my go-to database, I also lots of experience with MongoDB and a bunch of ORMs (Prisma, Drizzle, TypeORM, Mongoose).

    When it comes to running and fine-tuning LLMs, Replicate is my perferred cloud provider. I have an app called MelodyMakerAI that I built using Meta/music-gen, and I also enjoy exploring all the LLMs on the Replicate platform.

    Product Architecture is a great term used by Meta to encompass API & Client-Application design for user-facing products and services. I love this aspect of software development. Examples include Social networks, e-commerce stores, payment processing, messaging, real-time interactions, streaming (not just audio/video but data and UI streaming - especially with the advent of AI).

    I'm also comfortable with distributed systems, with experience in the Azure ecosystem for running microservices, redis/KV stores, data replication, and load balancers.

    Lastly, I have extensive experience with Payment Processing, using nearly all of Stripe's product offerings as well as card-present transactions for several payment gateways including Spin and Tenerum.
