  Almost entirely vibe-coded, I had to manually integrate real-time webhooks and make a few modifications to the client-side supabase configuration.

Integrates with Spotify to select songs for inspiration in addition to a text description of the music to generate.

Generates music by using Replicate to run Meta's MusicGen LLM based on a system & user prompt.

Used Supabase for the database, storage, and webhooks.

Used v0 to generate code for the UI, API routes, & spotify/replicate/supabase integrations.
