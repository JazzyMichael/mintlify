- Kiosk company

I began my career at an early-stage startup building self-order kiosks for restaurants. I was a founding software engineer and architected nearly every piece of technology in the entire company.

I built a frontend application designed for touch-screen kiosks. The touch-screen hardware was a "Chromebase" running ChromeOS and running a form of PWA/Chrome-Extension that was built as a single-page application using Angular & Javascript.

I built all of the hardware integrations for several receipt printers and in-person payment pin-pads, spanning all aspects of the system from the frontend application, to API routes, database queries, and a UDP scanning system to configure these connections during the initial setup process and manage them remotely.

I built a dashboard application for restaurant admins to manage and analyze every piece of data going through the system, and provided an abstraction on top of the restaurant POS systems to allow admins to configure menu items and promotions on the kiosk separate from the POS. There were times when I worked late hours, weekends, and even slept at the office.

**This was one of the best experiences of my life**, and I reflect on this fondly with a desire to do this with more leverage on a greater scale. At the time I was not aware that my contributions and software engineering proficiency was exceptional, as I was self-taught and learned directly from the official sources and industry leaders. I was shocked and saddened to discover most people do not even try to do epic things, let alone have an appreciation for learning and life.

I've been a top-performing engineer at every company I've worked with, and this has become a problem because it gets lonely and doesn't provide opportunities for high impact work and growth.

Now I am well aware of the general software engineering landscape and state of the industry, and my work experiences have led me to be very deliberate in my pursuit of companies to work with.

I am only interested in working with high-performers who share my values of integrity, curiosity, and learning. This is a major source of fulfillment, and frankly entertainment, because I love everything about software, internet, and building things.

The current expansion at Mintlify is the perfect opportunity to team up, and I would love to knock your socks off in an interview setting.
