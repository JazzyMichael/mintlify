## Best Possible Job Application

A project built using the Mintlify platform.

The goal is to stand-out from the other applicants by showcasing my interest in Mintlify with a cool & customized documentation-style portfolio. It's easy for standard applications to get overlooked, and I want to do everything I can for an opportunity to interview.

This [Senior Frontend Engineer](https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/Mintlify/596990a3-1198-46f0-bb96-b31203b5f92d)is a perfect fit, but I am also open to fullstack & forward deployed roles.
