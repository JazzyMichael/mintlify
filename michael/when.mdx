## When did I get inspired to build software?

Sold my Pokemon cards in 6th grade to buy the iPod touch when it was released.

AP Java class in high-school.

Love the web & impact tech has on the world. Mintlify is in a unique position to power many companies.

## When did I make this project?

Youtube videos -> research company -> apply -> best possible way to get noticed is to use the product to make some docs as a portfolio & custom job application when following up with cold emails.

## When can I start?

Right now, let's go!
