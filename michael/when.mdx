## When did I get inspired to build software?

Sold my Pokemon cards in 6th grade to buy the iPod touch when it was released.

AP Java class in high-school.

Love the web & impact tech has on the world. Mintlify is in a unique position to power many companies.

Ironically I worked on the App Store and run a Pokemon card website now :)

## When did I make this project?

Youtube videos -> research company -> apply -> best possible way to get noticed is to use the product to make some docs as a portfolio & custom job application when following up with cold emails.

## When can I start?

I'm willing to break my current apartment lease early so I can move to Silicon Valley as soon as I get the opportunity!
