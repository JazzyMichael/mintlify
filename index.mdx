# Are you willing to work in-office?

Began my career in 2018 working in-office, started working remote in 2020, now in 2025 I'm not just looking to work in-office, I'm looking to relocate to san francisco. (No visa sponsorship needed either)

# What are you looking for in your next role?

I'm looking for a community of people who love what they do, all working together to build something amazing.

Let's face it - most people are horrible at their jobs. Most people don't care about the work they do. Most people don't recognize the value, fulfillment, and beauty that comes from learning. And most people don't even try to do incredible things and reach their potential.

In the most recent "Inside YC Startup" vlog on Will's channel, a topic about the tech industry being saturated by many software engineers, but not many top performers who can actually get shit done was brought up, and I have observed the same phenomenon.

This is why it is extremely important to work with people who share values of learning, curiosity, integrity, and positive impact through hard work.

Life is a constant cycle of growth, fueled by curiosity and learning. I get lots of fulfillment from learning and applying knowledge to solve real-world problems.

Some of my fondest moments in life (not just my career) are from working at early-stage startups building software all day and night - literally sleeping in the office to build world-class apps.

I've been a top-performing engineer at every place I've worked, and with modern innovations in AI-codegen/dev-tooling, 10x engineers like me are turning into 100x engineers, and it seems this is exactly what you're looking for.

This is an incredible opportunity for everyone involved, and I'm ready to relocate from Amish Country to Silicon Valley to take Mintlify to the next level.

I treat software engineering the same way a professional athlete treats sports, and I would love to join your team!

# Mintlify

Check out the pages I created using the Mintlify platform to learn more about me and my feedback on some aspects of the platform!

I opened a couple pull requests and issues in the public github repos. These are not just to show off my web dev skillz, they are impactful changes that can reduce customer support requests and create more happy customers on the platform.
